# Welcome Screen - Flows example

This example showcases a welcome screen powered by the built-in Modal component from `@flows/react-components`.

A welcome screen is the first thing a new user sees when they open your app. Use it to greet the user by name, explain the value they are about to get, and point them at their first action so they reach that first win faster.

## Demo

## Features

When a user opens the application for the first time, they are greeted by a welcome modal that sits on top of the project management dashboard. The modal includes a friendly greeting, a short value statement, and a primary "Get started" call to action that closes the screen and drops the user into the app. Because the modal only targets first-time users, returning users go straight to the dashboard.

Below is a screenshot of how the workflow is set up:
