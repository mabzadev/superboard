# Tour example application – Flows example

This example showcases an inline card component powered by `@flows/react` and the built-in components from `@flows/react-components`.

Tours are multi-step flows used to guide users through new, undiscovered, or changed products and features.

Good tours:

- Are concise and direct (try to limit them to five steps).
- Match the user’s context (don’t show a tour for a feature the user has already explored).
- Use short, meaningful copy.

## Features

When a user opens the application for the first time, they encounter a welcome modal, followed by a series of steps that showcase various features of Flows. Modal, Tooltip, and Hint components are built-in components from `@flows/react-components`, while the inline card component is custom-built and can be found in the [`custom-card.tsx`](./src/components/custom-card.tsx) file.

Below is a screenshot demonstrating the workflow configuration for this Tour example:
