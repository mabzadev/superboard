## Features

This example showcases multiple components that can be used to announce your Product Hunt launch inside your app.

- **Sidebar card**: The sidebar card is a great way to announce your Product Hunt launch without overlaying important content. It is an embeddable component that can be placed in the sidebar of your app using the `FlowsSlot` component.
- **Floating banner**: A classic way to handle in-app announcements. The floating banner shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen and can be dismissed by the user. It is easier to implement because it doesn’t require you to implement a slot in your app.
- **Top bar banner**: Similarly to the sidebar card, the top bar banner is a great way to announce your Product Hunt launch without overlaying important content. It slides in from the top of the screen to catch the user’s attention. It is also an embeddable component that can be placed in the top bar of your app using the `FlowsSlot` component.
