# Onboarding hub – Flows example

This example showcases an onboarding hub with a checklist powered by `@flows/react`.

An onboarding hub is a home in your app for onboarding and help resources. They’re super
flexible and could include a getting started checklist, general tips for the best next step,
and entry points to interactive tours, documentation, and support. The onboarding hub
typically has a permanent place in the navigation until dismissed or completed.

## Features

When a user open the application, they are greeted with a sidebar widget that calls out the
getting started page. The user can click on the widget to open the onboarding hub, which
contains a checklist of suggested setup actions, a button to launch a product tour, and a
list of useful links to documentation and support resources.

Below is a screenshot of how the workflow is set up:
