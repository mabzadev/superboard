This example demonstrates a 5-point emoji microsurvey embedded in a React analytics dashboard, powered by Flows.

## Demo

[View the live demo](https://flows.sh/examples/microsurvey)

## Features

The Flows workflow shows a 5-point emoji reaction widget (from very unhappy to very happy) to users after they open the analytics report. The survey appears automatically as a non-intrusive overlay - no page navigation required. Users submit their rating with a single click and the response is captured by Flows. The low-friction format makes it ideal for collecting quick in-app feedback on reports, dashboards, or any feature.

Below is a screenshot of how the workflow is set up:
