# Embedded tips – Flows example

This example shows how to use Flows to build contextual, embedded tips to onboard users. Each page has a simple tip that helps users learn about important product and UI concepts.

## Demo

[View the live demo](https://flows.sh/examples/embedded-tips)

## Features

When a user enters the workflow and visits one of the pages with `FlowsSlot` components, an inline tip will appear to help them learn about the features on the page. Each tip uses a custom component to render the content.

Below is a screenshot of how the workflow is set up:
