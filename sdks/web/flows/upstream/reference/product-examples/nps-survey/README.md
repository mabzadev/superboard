# Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey - Flows example

This example shows how to collect Net Promoter Score feedback in a React app using the built-in Survey Popover component from `@flows/react-components`. The survey triggers automatically after a delay, appears in the corner of the screen, and guides users through a rating question and a follow-up, without interrupting their workflow.

## Features

When a user enters the workflow, the survey popover appears in the bottom-right corner of the screen. The survey walks users through three steps:

1. **NPS rating**: a 0-10 numeric scale asking how likely the user is to recommend the product, with "Not likely" and "Very likely" labels at each end.
2. **Follow-up question**: an open-ended freeform text field asking for the reason behind the score. Marked as optional so users can skip it.
3. **End screen**: a thank-you message acknowledging the response before the popover closes automatically.

Below is a screenshot of how the workflow is set up:
