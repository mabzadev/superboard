# Hint example application – Flows example

This example showcases a set of built-in Hint components powered by `@flows/react-components`.

Hints provide users with on-demand and contextual guidance. Hints use small beacons that encourage users to focus on certain features, then progressively disclose more information when the user interacts with them.

Hints are useful for:

- Contextual education and help
- To draw attention to a new feature without interrupting a user’s workflow.
- Gently nudge users to explore, learn, or take action.

## Features

When a user enters the workflow and visits the home page, three hints are shown to gently nudge users to explore the features of the application. The hint next to the description label is linked to another hint that shows up after the previous hint is completed.

Below is a screenshot of how the workflow is set up:
