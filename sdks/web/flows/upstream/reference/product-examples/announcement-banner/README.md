# Announcement banner - Flows example

This example shows how to display a dismissible announcement banner at the top of your React app using a custom component powered by Flows.

## Demo

## Features

When a user enters the workflow, an announcement banner slides in at the top of the application. The banner includes:

- A labeled badge (e.g. "New") to draw attention to the announcement
- A short message describing the feature or update
- A "Learn more" link that opens the full announcement in a new tab
- A dismiss button that advances the workflow and removes the banner

The banner is registered as a custom Flows component and rendered via a `FlowsSlot` placed above the main layout. Flows controls when the banner appears, what text it displays, and where the link points - all configurable from the workflow editor without touching the code.

Below is a screenshot of how the workflow is set up:
