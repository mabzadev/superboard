# Interactive feature announcement – Flows example

This example showcases an interactive feature announcement powered by `@flows/react` to announce a new feature and give users a preview of how it works.

Interactive feature announcements are a great way to introduce new features to users and help them understand how they work. Instead of just telling users about a new feature, you can show them how it works in an interactive way.

## Features

When a user enters the Interactive Feature Announcement block in a workflow and, a modal appears. In this example, the modal is a custom UI component announcing the release of a dark mode support to the app. The modal gives users the option to select which theme they want to use (light, dark, or system default).

Below is a screenshot of how the workflow is set up:
