# Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) survey - Flows example

This example shows how to collect Customer Satisfaction Score feedback in a React app using the built-in Survey Popover component from `@flows/react-components`. The survey triggers automatically, appears in the corner of the screen, and asks users to rate their satisfaction and optionally explain their answer.

## Demo

## Features

When a user enters the workflow, the survey popover appears in the bottom-right corner of the screen. The survey walks users through three steps:

1. **Satisfaction rating**: a 1-5 star scale asking how satisfied the user is with the product.
2. **Follow-up question**: an open-ended freeform text field asking what could be improved. Marked as optional so users can skip it.
3. **End screen**: a thank-you message acknowledging the response before the popover closes automatically.

Below is a screenshot of how the workflow is set up:
