# Feature announcement – Flows example

This example showcases a full page dialog feature announcement powered by `@flows/react` to announce a new feature to users.

Feature announcements are a great way to introduce new features to users and help them understand how they work, however they can sometimes be dismissed too quickly if they interrupt the user’s workflow.

## Features

When an existing user comes back to the app the feature announcement will be displayed to them right away. In this example the dialog is a custom UI component that is made up of multiple steps that explain the new feature.

Below is a screenshot of how the workflow is set up:
