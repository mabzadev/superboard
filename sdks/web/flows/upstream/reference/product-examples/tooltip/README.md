## Features

This example shows a 4-step tooltip workflow that points users to the most important parts of an analytics dashboard:

1. **Stats row** - Draws attention to the KPI cards at the top of the dashboard so users understand what metrics are tracked.
2. **Main chart** - Points to the visitors-over-time chart and explains how to read the data.
3. **Top pages** - Highlights the top-pages panel and explains how to drill into individual pages.
4. **Create report button** - Ends the tour by pointing users to the action that creates a new report.

Each step uses the built-in `BasicsV2Tooltip` component from `@flows/react-components/tour`, which anchors a floating tooltip to a CSS selector on the page. Steps advance with a "Next" button and users can dismiss the tour at any time.

Below is a screenshot of how the workflow is set up:
