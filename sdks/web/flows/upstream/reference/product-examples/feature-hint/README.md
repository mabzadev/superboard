# Feature hint – Flows example

This example showcases a custom feature hint component that can be used to highlight new features in your product. The component is designed to be dismissible, allowing users to easily close it once they have acknowledged the new feature. The feature hint is built using the `@flows/react` and `@floating-ui/react` SDKs, and uses Flows to manage its state and behavior.

The component has two optional buttons: a primary button used to acknowledge the new feature and a secondary button that can be used to link to a page with more information about the feature or announcement post.
