# Card example application – Flows example

A custom card component built with the Flows SDK to render content inline.

This example showcases an inline card component powered by `@flows/react` which uses `FlowsSlot` to display content based on the user’s workflow state.

Cards are particularly useful for presenting contextual information—such as new feature announcements or helpful tips—without overwhelming the user.

## Features

When a user enters the Card block in a workflow and visits the home page, the card component appears in the `homepage-slot`. In this example, the card is a custom UI element displaying a title and body text with two buttons to continue or close the card.

The card offers two exit nodes—continue and close—that allow users to either proceed to the next workflow step or close the card if more blocks are connected.

Below is a screenshot of how the Card block is set up in the workflow:
