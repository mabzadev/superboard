# Enterprise upsell – Flows example

This example showcases enterprise upsell card powered by `@flows/react`. In-page promotion is one of the most effective channels for product upsell especially compared to email outreach. This upsell card strikes the balance between being informative and non-intrusive. It is designed to meet the user at the right moment when they are most likely to be interested in the product.

## Demo

## Features

When a user that doesn’t have an enterprise plan visits the page, they will see a card that promotes the enterprise plan in a non-intrusive way. The card is designed to be informative and not obstructive to the user experience. The user can use the cards buttons to upgrade, learn more or dismiss the card altogether.

Below is a screenshot of how the workflow is set up:
